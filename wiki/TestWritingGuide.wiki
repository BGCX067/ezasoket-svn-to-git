#summary Guide for How to Write Unit Test Code and Report Bugs
=Guide for Writing the Test Code=

==Introduction==

This is the guide for writing test code as a means to report bugs.

==Details==

  * Always use single quotes to avoid problems compiling on the mainframe.
  * Use COMPBIN as the variable type where you want it to be replaced with COMP, BINARY, or COMP-5 based on the test.
  * Make the test only test one thing.
  * A test is failed if the output contains FAIL or does not contain COMPLETE.
  * Some tests are simple and are self contained within a COBOL program.
  * Some tests are complex and involve invoking a pair of programs or require comparison of external data.
  * It is preferred if bugs are reported using test code so that the solution can easily be tested on all platforms.
