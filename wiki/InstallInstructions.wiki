#summary Installation Instructions
=This is the installation instructions for Open Source EZASOKET=

The prerequisites for following these instructions are that you have a C compiler and a COBOL compiler installed.  

Currently gcc is supported for the C compiler.  MicroFocus and OpenCOBOL are the COBOL compilers supported.  We are keen on supporting others provided we can get access to the target environment.

These are step by step instructions for installing Open Source EZASOKET.  The instructions in fixed-width font are cut-and-paste ready for your command line.

  # login as a non-root user.
  # {{{mkdir ezasoket}}}
  # {{{cd ezasoket}}}
  # download and unbundle the source using one of these methods:
    # subversion:
      * {{{svn checkout http://ezasoket.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ trunk}}}
    # curl:
      * {{{curl http://ezasoket.googlecode.com/files/osezasoket_0.4.1.tar}}}
      * {{{tar -xf osezasoket_0.4.1.tar}}}
    # Typical Programmer Ingenuity
      * download osezasoket_0.4.1.tar from the "Downloads" tab and somehow copy it to the current working directory.
      * {{{tar -xf osezasoket_0.4.1.tar}}}
  # note that the previous instruction created a directory called trunk. 
  # {{{cd trunk}}}
  # {{{./configure}}}
  # {{{make}}}
  # {{{cd test}}}
  # {{{./expand 1}}}
  # {{{./compile 1}}}
  # {{{./runtests 1}}}
  # repeat steps 10 through 12 for each test 1-12? that is valid for this installation.
